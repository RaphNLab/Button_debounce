# Introduction 
TODO: Give a short introduction of your project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project. 

The aim of this project is to implement an audio recorder and player whith the STM32F411 discovery board.
The idea is to understand how audio I2S interface works and use it to play music or record audio.
Trough serial interface an external application transmits audio files to the STM32F411 board, which then stores the collected data into FLASH memory.
Stored audio data will be transmited to I2S interface.
